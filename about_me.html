						<h2>History</h2>
									<p>Born and raised in a small town in a hot, dusty part of South Africa, I always had a love for computers.
										After graduating high school, I worked in a few different IT jobs, mainly as a technician. After a few years,
										 the travel-bug	bit and I decided to do some exploring of the world while I was still young. I initially 
										 joined my sister in Ireland where I did an introductory course in Computer Game Design. After that I returned to
										 South Africa but I was not done with my travels quite yet. I was on the family farm, looking online for oppertunities
										 internationally when I found an offer of work to teach English in China. Deciding that I was happy for that experience,
										 I soon found myself on a plane heading to Beijing to spend the next 6 months learning the streets and back-alleys
										 of one of the largest cities in the world.
									</p>
									<p>After I decided to leave China, I headed to Thailand to continue my teaching career and have proceeded to spend the next
										few years travelling all over Asia while working as a teacher in classrooms and then later moving on to teaching online. 
										It was moving my teaching to an online format that has re-ignited my love to all things IT and encouraged me to start looking
										for ways to specilise into a more specific field that I was more interested in.
									</p>
									<p>I was on a visit home when I met my wife. She is from New York, America and was stationed near my home town in South Africa 
										while working with the Peace Corps. After a whirlwind romance, we got married and my wife joined me as my adventure partner 
										as we both returned to Asia and continued with my travels. We are currently living in Thailand where we decided to ride out the 
										Covid-19 Pandemic. I have applied for a green card to the USA based on my marriage and should be recieving it sometime near the 
										end of 2021(Hopefully). 
									</p>
